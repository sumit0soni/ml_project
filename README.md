*Objective is to pick below ML problems and for this Dataset is to be taken from Keggle.*

**Binary Classification:** Predicting whether an instance belongs to one of two classes (e.g., spam or not spam).

**Multi-class Classification:** Predicting the class label from more than two classes (e.g., classifying images of animals into different species).

**Regression:** Predicting a continuous numeric value (e.g., predicting house prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, etc.).

**Clustering:** Grouping similar instances together based on certain features without predefined labels (e.g., customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior).

**Dimensionality Reduction:** Reducing the number of input features while retaining the essential information (e.g., using techniques like Principal Component Analysis).

**Anomaly Detection:** Identifying instances that are significantly different from the majority of the data (e.g., detecting fraudulent transactions in financial data).

**Recommendation Systems:** Recommending items or content to users based on their preferences and behavior (e.g., movie recommendations, product recommendations).

**Natural Language Processing (NLP):**
  _Sentiment Analysis:_ Determining the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) expressed in text.
  _Named Entity Recognition:_ Identifying and classifying entities (e.g., names, organizations) in text.
  _Text Classification:_ Categorizing text into predefined classes or categories.

**Time Series Forecasting:** Predicting future values based on historical data (e.g., stock price prediction, weather forecasting).

**Image Recognition:** Classifying objects or scenes in images (e.g., recognizing handwritten digits, identifying objects in photographs).

**Reinforcement Learning:** Training agents to make sequential decisions in an environment to maximize a reward signal (e.g., game playing, robotic control).

**Semi-Supervised and Unsupervised Learning:** Learning from partially labeled data or without labeled data at all (e.g., self-training, clustering).

**Ensemble Methods:** Combining predictions from multiple models to improve overall performance (e.g., Random Forests, Gradient Boosting).

**Transfer Learning:** Leveraging pre-trained models on one task and fine-tuning them for a different but related task.

**Adversarial Machine Learning:** Understanding and defending against attacks on machine learning models (e.g., adversarial attacks on image classifiers).

**AutoML (Automated Machine Learning):** Using automated tools and frameworks to automate the machine learning pipeline, including feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning.
